1
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,110
You've taken a coding boot camp

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,179
and passed all of your exams,

3
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,650
but you haven't been able to get a job.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,554
You see the layoffs
from Big Tech and wondering,

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:26,559
Are my skills already obsolete? Yes.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,261
Yes they are.

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,997
And that's why
we created a Rust for the Resilient.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,967
You've already proven that

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,169
you can learn how to code.

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,939
Now it's time to learn how to code
like it's 2023

11
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,409
and get a job with a Fortune 1000

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,213
by migrating to Rust, the language
adopted by groups

13
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,017
like Microsoft,
Facebook, Amazon, Cloudflare and Linux.

14
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:55,789
You'll become immediately
relevant to software development managers

15
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,925
who are rewriting their entire codebase.

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,829
Rust for the Resilient -

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,931
Take the entrance exam now

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,535
to see if you qualify.
